# Xirox

This Github Repository is for Xirox - a clone of Twitter (before X). This is basically for me; and for you because you get free code without wasting 4+ Hours and for me I get a free backup. You can change the background color, the Name of the Account, etc.

The pictures come from [here](https://kdscoder.com/welcome/video_source_code/K_eV7MhujeE)

**(Thanks KDS Coder!)**

## Run Locally

Clone the project and Run it on XAMPP.

(**PS:** I would reccommend an alternative domain from localhost to change the emersion effect.)

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/l-xdt/xirox
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd xirox
```

Install XAMPP (via Choclatey ~ If you dont have it).

```bash
  choclatey install xampp
```

Start the server

```bash
    [Directory]/[ServerName]/apache-start.bat
```

**PS:**Here is the manual on how to create a self-hosted domain: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (By Soeng Song)

## Roadmap

## FAQ

#### Can the code be changed to show what I want?

Xirox, is made by Leidenschaft. We prioritise customizeability an quality. the rest don't matter to us. This means, yes! You can.

#### Can I host this, If  I can how?

Yes.. you can. Using XAMPP.

You see, when you host a website on XAMPP it will be hosted on localhost, leading to 127.0.0.1: This is the same on Every computer around the world whether you are running Windows 11 or Arch Linux.

I have loved XAMPP for how stress-free it is for beginners but feel free to use anything that works for you. But I recommend XAMPP (for this **<3**)

I talked about beginners ~ So here is a tutorial for you guys. By MainlyWebStuff: linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no). , And for you guys who want more experience: put a blank domain, tutorial linked: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs)

#### Any PS's for the questions

**PS:** You don't really need to host this on XAMPP: but atleast Extract it; although the Index will have some problems.
